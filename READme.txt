   INTRODUCTION :

Visually-challenged people constitute a large part of the physically-challenged section of the society. The aid available to them is quite simple. In todayâ€™s world of expanding technology it would be helpful if we could use technology to assist them in their daily routine. 
	So we came up with an improvised blind-stick which consists of a few sensors. We also came up with a blind-band which has a camera mounted on it which gives a wider angle of vision. This camera can recognize a range of objects and colors which could help the blind person to get partial vision of his surroundings.
